# Basic-C
Code from the book 'The C Programming Language' by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.  

Code samples are organized by chapter.  

Code doesn't look like it does in the book? That's because I did the exercises after the chapter. Check the file history to see the initial code and how the exercises change / modify the code to their present state. 

I'll sometimes add screenshots of the output.

As it stands, due to lack of knowledge or dissatisfaction with answers on the internet, I've chosen to skip the following exercises - but will revisit them:  

Exercise 1-13 "Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a **vertical orientation is more challenging.**"

I have not done the vertical orientation portion of this challenge.

To Do:

Import and use the gmp library to work with the product of chapter 1.8, which I've turned into a rudimentary password keyspace calculator. It currently tops out at 4,533,461,702,709,235,777 as it's highest number (95 ^ 10). We need more than that.
