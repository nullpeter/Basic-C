# Basic-C
Code from the book 'The C Programming Language' by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.  

Code samples are organized by chapter.  

Code doesn't look like it does in the book? That's because I did the exercises after the chapter. Check the file history to see the initial code and how the exercises change / modify the code to their present state. 

I'll sometimes add screenshots of the output.
